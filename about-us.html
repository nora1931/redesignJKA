                        <h2>Collections and projects</h2>
                        <p>World In Motion is collections based on cities we choose to visit and buy second-hand clothing from. We then give every piece new life by creating it to a new product. Each product is re-designed by us and is a unique 1/1 product.
                            Previous collections:
                            World In Motion 2.0 Berlin
                            World In Motion 3.0 Copenhagen
                            World In Motion 4.0 Tokyo </p>
                        <p>JKA Archive is "drop" based collections with the same purpose of taking second-hand clothing or dead stock products and give it new life. We buy second-hand wholesale in different categories and release it in small drops. Each product is re-designed by us and is a unique 1/1 product.
                            Previous drops:
                            JKA Archive - Summer mix
